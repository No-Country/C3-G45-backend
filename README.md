The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.
You'll need to do a couple of things in order to run this project on your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/No-Country/C3-G45-backend.git
git clone https://github.com/No-Country/C3-G45.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```sh
# For backend
cd C3-G45-backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```sh
# For frontend
cd C3-G45
npm install # or yarn install
```

3. Run the backend server:

```sh
python3 manage.py makemigrations  # Create migrations
python3 manage.py migrate         # Apply migrations
python3 manage.py createsuperuser # Pick whatever user and password you want
python3 manage.py runserver       # This is a development server
```
